Idea of a possible language game.

Qichwabase contains information about lexemes and for some also the region in which they are spoken. 
For these regions, we can also find geographical information. 

The game would now be show the user a work and a map. The user then clicks the map indicating where the user things the work is used. If this is correct, the user gains points.
